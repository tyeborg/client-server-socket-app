# Listening Linux Kernel Module Project

This is a fully operational project (written in C) demonstrating how to develop a Linux Kernel Module that is able to listen to incoming connections.

Every component of this project evaluates the following:

* Construction of a simple program using methods of layering, error detection and recovery, and reflection of error status across layers
* Implementation of a simple client-server socket-based application

## Installation

Clone this repository by git clone https://github.com/tyeborg/client-server-socket-app.git

## Usage

1. To build the Linux Kernel Module, you will need to run the following command line in your Linux Machine to install Linux Kernel Headers:

```bash
sudo apt install linux-headers-$(uname â€“r)
```
2. Afterwards, open a terminal to commence initialization of the Kernel module. **To build the Kernel module, the Makefile is needed**.

The content within the Makefile is displayed below:

```Makefile
obj-m += server.o

all:
	make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) modules

clean:
	make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) clean
```

3. With the existence of the Makefile, enter <ins>*make*</ins> into the command line to build the Kernel module. 

4. Once the Kernel module is built, install it by using the following insmod terminal command:

```bash
sudo insmod server.ko
```

*Viola! At this point, the Kernel module launched a kernel thread which will listen to incoming connections on the defined port of 5000.*

5. Open a separate terminal to build the Client module
    * Build the module using `gcc client.c -o client` on the terminal.
    * Run the module using `./client` on the terminal.

*Fantastic, the Client module and the Kernel module are running together simultaneously! Now it is time to establish a connection between them...*

As the Kernel module is listening to incoming connections, you (as the client) can fulfill them if and only if both modules are running on the same port. Therefore in the Client module, ensure <ins>*5000*</ins> is entered when prompted with which port to connect to. When a connection is received, an absolute filename is able to be read from the client.

## Additional Information

To access kernel messages that are printed onto the log, use the following command in the terminal: `dmesg`

## Project Evaluation

*"Kernel module builds and runs, but it doesn't seem to always get a file, and cannot reconnect. So, generally working and well put together with a few bugs in place."* - Kevin Chalmers
